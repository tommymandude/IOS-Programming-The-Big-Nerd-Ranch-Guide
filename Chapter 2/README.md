### Gold Challenge: Another Class

This challenge is to create a subclass of BNRItem named BNRContainer. The BNRContainer should
contain BNRItems. Printing the BNRContainer description should show the name of the container,
the total value and a list of all BNRItem it contains. Take a look at my BNRContainer class files to see how I implemented my solution.
